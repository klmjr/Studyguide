	/*Key terms gone over during the practice quiz in calss.
	 * 
	 *  
	 *  Abstract method: can only be declared in an abstract class. 
	 * Must be fully implemented in any class that extends the abstract class.
	 * can include access modifiers. Not an interface
	 * 
	 * Private, protected and public access modifiers are shared through different
	 * classes in the same package
	 * 
	 * Overloading: Changes the implementation of a non-constructor method in the superclass
	 * Annotation is optional, but best practice
	 * Cannot restrict the visibility of the method
	 * 
	 * Encapsulation:Instance attributes are private. 
	 * Using getter and setter methods to manipulate the contents of the
	 * instance variable
	 * 
	 * Interface:Not a class but compiles with a .class extension
	 * Provides a rule set a list of methods that must be implemented
	 * Method sigantures are used, but no access modifiers
	 * 
	 * Final:Declare variable so it cant be extended or overridden, value must be
	 * set in declaration
	 * Declare a Class so it cant be extended
	 * Declare a method so it cant be overridden (but can be called by subclass)
	 * 
	 * How do you call a no arg constructor through a 2 arg constructor? using this()
	 * 
	 * What does maven do? Handles external dependencies. Handles compile. installation
	 * Executes unit testing
	 * 
	 * enum:Special data type that enables for a variable to be set of predefined constants
	 * The variable must be equal to one of the values that have been predefined for it.
	 * Like ranks and suits
